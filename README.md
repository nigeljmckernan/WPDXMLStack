This project is to use the [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) [Water Point Data Exchange](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-05-04/readme.md) dataset to fit multiple machine learning models, as well as fitting an ensemble model stack. The dependent variable is whether a given water pump has water flowing or not, based on around 40+ features determined from the underlying dataset.
