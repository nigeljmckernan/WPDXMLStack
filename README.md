_________________

This project is to use the [Water Point Data Exchange](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/blob/master/data/2021/2021-05-04/readme.md) dataset to fit multiple machine learning models, as well as fitting an ensemble model stack. The dependent variable is whether a given water pump has water flowing or not. 

Detailed feature engineering is explored in the [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) document in this repository.
